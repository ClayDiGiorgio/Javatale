PROJECT TITLE: Javatale
AUTHOR:        Rocco "Clay" DiGiorgio V

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
To create an open source engine for fans of the game Undertale (by Toby Fox) to create their own content, and enjoy my own custom content.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
Unfortunately, the .jar executable was too large for GitHub to upload, so I have included a link to a Google Drive download. After downloading the rest of the project's files to a folder, please follow the link in the text file "link_to_jar_on_Google_Drive.txt" and download the .jar you find. Place this in the same folder that you placed the rest of the project files. The project will run when you double click the jar file. 

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
The only controls are the arrow keys, Z (or alternatively, Enter), and X (or Right Shift). If you are unfamiliar with the game's mechanics, please navigate to "Tutorial Battle" on the main menu (using the arrow keys) and press either Enter or Z. Enjoy!

PS: See if you can beat the "Small Dog" battle. It's harder than it looks at first!
